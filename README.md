# SuMarket

A student-to-student marketplace app for Sabanci University.

## 📱 Overview
At the start and end of each semester, many students want to buy or sell items like fridges, books, and furniture.  
**SuMarket** connects buyers and sellers directly, making it easier to find deals and avoid group chat chaos.

### 🎯 Features
- Browse and post listings (e.g. fridges, books, electronics)
- Message and conversate with sellers/buyers.
- Add listings to your favorites to come back to later.
- Recieve notifications when someone favorites your listing.
- Manage and keep track of all your listings in a My Listings page.
- Toggle between dark & light mode.
- Change profile information.


Therefore we thought there is a possible opportunity here to deliver a platform for both sellers, making their offer visible as well as potential buyers getting good deals without having to skim through groupchats.
