# SuMarket

A student-to-student marketplace app for Sabancı University.

## 📱 Overview
At the start and end of each semester, many students want to buy or sell items like fridges, books, and furniture.  
**SuMarket** connects buyers and sellers directly, making it easier to find deals and avoid group chat chaos.

### 🎯 Features
- Browse and post listings (e.g. fridges, books, electronics)
- Message sellers directly
- Optional delivery and verification system
- Category-based browsing (e.g. dorm items, electronics, books)
- Scam prevention through user verification

Therefore we thought there is a possible opportunity here to deliver a platform for both sellers, making their offer visible as well as potential buyers getting good deals without having to skim through groupchats.

Hence our app will offer a main feed to view offers and message the sellers as well as select options like delivery and whatever additional features that we may later come up with regarding this topic.
